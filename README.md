Here is the test I received.

I wanted to make some notes.

1. This uses no libraries but may not work in older versions of IE including IE9 because of the way I handled using classList.  To make it more compatible it would take a small change.

2. The js needs a window resize method or some equivalent because the menus do not know when they are open and the window is resized.

3. The instructions asked for the links to resolve to new pages.  But the json nodes contain hashes which prevent this.  I assumed you did this intentionally so I did not parse them out.

4. The instructions also asked that the menu slide from the right to the left but the positioning of the layout in the provided design pdfs seemed to indicate they opened left to right.  I implemented it opening left to right and it seems to work very well aesthetically.

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to take this test.
